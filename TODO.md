# Use cases

As a developer, I'm excited to be able to edit files in the browser easily, God willing, for efficiency and progress and changing/experimenting.

As a developer/user, I'm hopeful to be able to download, build, and/or host an arbitrary package, God willing, for novelty, efficiency, inspiration and being effective users.

As a user, I'm excited to have fast commands, especially fs commands, God willing.
- possibly by running cash compiler / bin/bash indefinitely, God willing. And invoking in a different manner, God willing! In this case, we're sending commands to a process that just stays open, almost as if it was running in the service worker, God bless.
- besides fs being in SW, seems like just a place to put common stuff while workers can be communicate some other way by passing messageports to the service worker, God bless.
- this might mean we have some dedicated worker that does readline first, and perhaps have cash loaded up there or ran as a worker too, God willing, since figuring out what executable to run may use sync apis, God willing.

As a user, I'm content and confident by persistent file system and even persistent history logs, God willing.
- .cash_history file, God willing, to append each line to, God willing. load up a few on boot, grab some more appropriately, God willing.

- history via file
- fetch implemenation via file/commands, God willing, systemctl
- save to filer,
